## Hi there 👋

🐍 I’m currently learning Python

🐾Fun fact:
- I love nature — trees don’t crash like my code
- I have a dog who’s always beside me while I code — chilling in a comfy chair stacked with cushions like royalty 🐕👑
- I am a Co-founder of a startup (yes, I drink coffee now)

Wanna say hi or talk about open source? Let’s connect!
